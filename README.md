# Code used in Zanini et al. on neonatal lung endothelial cells
To keep an eye on what we do: http://fabilab.org.

# Folder structure
`lungsc` contains the code in various subfolders:
- `ingest` contains the code used for merging different sequencing runs, filtering, and packaging the gene counts, and for cell type and subtype annotation
- `figures` contains the scripts used in the figure making

Of course, contact Fabio Zanini or open an issue on this repository for access to more data or scripts.

**NOTE:** the pipeline to map the reads etc. is the same as in [our neonatal immunity repo](https://github.com/iosonofabio/lung_neonatal_immune).
